# Sand Tetris
Sand Tetris is a variation of the classic Tetris game where, instead of solid blocks, the falling pieces break apart into smaller fragments upon landing.
The goal is to connect fragments of the same color from left to right to clear them from the screen.

Players can control the blocks using the left and right arrow keys to move them horizontally, and the up arrow key to rotate the piece.
The game progresses through levels, with the pieces falling faster as the level increases.
